# Project Description

## Overview

This project involves the development of a simulated manipulator within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. The manipulator employs a combination of cutting-edge techniques to plan and execute its movements, including:

1. **Sequence Planning Algorithm**

2. **MoveIt Integration**

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enable the manipulator to autonomously navigate through a series of defined points along a given mesh surface. By doing so, it effectively marks the designated point on the mesh.
